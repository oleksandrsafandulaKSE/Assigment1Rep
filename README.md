bug explanation:
computer starts working slower

expected behaviour:
computer works fast

Matvii's solution:
Eliminate "vampire" processes. If an application or service isn't actively serving your current goal, terminate it. This recovers RAM and CPU cycles for your primary task.

Sasha's solution:
Clear the digital friction. Delete temporary caches and ensure your primary drive has at least 15-20% free space. A crowded drive creates a bottleneck for virtual memory and file indexing.

Pavlo's solution:
Prioritize performance over efficiency
